Overview
--------

The platform is divided into various components to keep it modular and
enables easy scaling for deployments. It also focuses on managing high
loads without much change and affecting performance.

Let us look into some of the main highlights the platform has to offer.

-  Support for **Global Project** across pipelines, notebooks, EDA, datasets etc. 


-  | Users can be part of multiple projects having **project specific pipelines, project specific datasets, project specific notebooks, project specific auto EDA** etc. This will help users to segregate their work and work with other team members on specific projects making it a seamless and hassle-free experience.

-  **Orchestrates Distributed Workflows and Automates ML Pipelines**.

   -  Brings complex integrations of distributed workflows using simple low-code configurations.

-  Transparent and straightforward operations so that the team can focus only on models, code, and data.

-  **Auto Exploratory Data Analysis**: Saves 60% of your time from any ML project by automating many steps, like identifying data issues, missing values, outliers, imbalanced datasets, and many more. It also provides bar charts, heatmaps, and other such visualizations for a detailed understanding of the dataset.

-  Workbench and notebooks for data scientists, data engineers, data analysts, administrators, etc.

-  Seamlessly scale pipelines from local development to batch execution and online serving in production

-  An agnostic architecture layer that improves operational efficiency and namespace segregation, provides differentiated auto-scaling, and thus reduces compute costs when deploying workloads.

-  **Reliable and fully manageable**: every workflow and its tasks are isolated, enabling different teams to collaborate without having to worry about affecting each otherâ€™s work.

-  Consistent Identities and Policies across different identity systems from one place by using an abstraction layer driven by a simple declarative API.

-  **Security and Confidentiality**: As a pure-play cloud offering, security, confidentiality, availability, and privacy of data are fundamental to the DSCW Platform. Not only do we leverage the inherent capabilities of public clouds in these four areas, but we provide additional capacities like strong compliance, strong encryption, etc.

-  **Telemetry out-of-box**: Integrations across all platform components for solutions hosted by the platform. Prebuilt consoles and 3rd party integration hooks for complete Observability, Traceability, Audit, Metrics, Logging, and Error exploration.

Why? 
----

-  Cloud-native, Simple and Secure

-  Less Administration, More Automation

-  Secure Data Exploration and Ad-hoc Data Analytics

-  Building scalable data pipelines for Machine Learning

-  Role-based collaboration of data, workflows, algorithms, and models across teams.

-  Build and drive your entire data science program under one roof.

-  Accelerate your AI strategy with Automatic ML.

-  Keep your existing tools and frameworks, and easily integrate all major AI tools in the DSCW Platform.

-  Prevent cloud-host lock-in: Seamlessly migrate data, solutions & apps across any cloud provider or on-prem

-  **DSCW Workbench**: Empower you to build and deploy portable, scalable machine learning workflows based on Docker containers. It consists of a user interface to manage jobs, an engine to schedule multi-step ML workflows, an SDK to define and manipulate pipelines, and notebooks to interact with the system via SDK.

-  **DSCW Serving**: Enables serverless inferencing on Kubernetes. It also provides high abstraction interfaces for ML frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, etc.

-  **Multi-tenancy**: Simplifies user operations to allow users to view and edit only the DSCW components and model artifacts in their configuration. Key concepts under this multi-user isolation include authentication, authorization, administrator, user, and profile.

-  **Training Operators:** This enables users to train ML models through operators. For instance, it provides Tensorflow training (TFJob) that runs TensorFlow model training on Kubernetes, PyTorchJob for Pytorch model training, etc.

-  **Notebooks:** Kubeflow deployment provides services for managing and spawning AI notebooks. Each DSCW deployment can include multiple notebook servers and each notebook server can include multiple notebooks.

-  **Role Based Access Control** : Update permissions, add new users as you grow, and give everyone the exact permissions they need.

Features of the Platform
------------------------

1. **Unified interface for AI Projects development and deployment across environments.**

-  Project specific workspaces to data/ML pipelines, track experiments and notebooks, complete versioning/serving of dataset & trained models, create and deploy APIs, server configurations as well as compute/memory resource allocation.

-  User Management: Attribute-Based Access Control for individual users and teams to restrict access to the above workspaces, data, and fields.

-  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [for Kubernetes Admins, Solution Integrators, Release Managers, Workspace Custodians, Solution Builders, Data Engineers, Data Scientists, Data Custodians, Code Custodians, and Business Owners], allowing configuration of varying levels of access across all Users within the Workspace.

-  Complete Kubernetes native platform to allow for autoscale. as well as support project/user specific compute/memory limits.

2. **Creating and Scheduling Data, ML & DeepLearning Pipelines**

-  Build data processing pipelines and use Pipelines to construct and visualize the workflow.

-  Low-code GUI to author, schedule, and monitor these workflows.

3. **Orchestrating Resources and Processing the data**

-  Automate deployment, scale, and manage containerized applications. Utilize in-memory caching and optimize query execution for fast queries against data of any size.

-  Requires user-specific minimal configuration for setting it up.

4. **DSCW Notebook Server**

-  Notebook Server Hub comprises the dashboard, admin control module, vault connector with proxy API, and the proxy public that interacts with each user's NB pods in the KubeSpawner present in the server.

-  Authenticators (Azure AD Connector & Base Auth) are used in the notebook server hub.

-  As a part of common utilities, it has code snippets (drag and drop) and data connectors (combine various sources of data into one integrated space).

-  Various kernels like TensorFlow kernel, PyTorch kernel, and python ML kernel allow running the respective Kubernetes cluster where the jobs can be scheduled and run.

-  A basic version control system with git integration is provided in DSCW Notebooks which allows users to keep their projects updated with the team.

5. **DSCW Workbench**

-  Workbench is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, version-able, testable, and collaborative.

-  Developers, data scientists, or data engineers access Workbench UI (running in K8s pod) through the Ingress Istio Gateway.

-  WFO server (running in K8s pod) comprises the scheduler and Celery-Kubernetes executors. These executors can run tasks through the celery queue or K8 queue in the backend.
