**Database Explorer** 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Database Explorer provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to
connect to various data sources and visualize the results of their
queries in a variety of ways. One of the key features of Database
Explorer is its collaboration capabilities, which allow multiple users
to work on the same query or project, and share their work with others.

One of the benefits of using Database Explorer is that it can help data
teams work more efficiently. By providing a centralized platform for
writing, running, and sharing SQL queries, Database Explorer can help
streamline the process of working with data. Additionally, the
collaboration features allow multiple team members to work on the same
query or project at the same time, which can save time and reduce the
risk of errors.
