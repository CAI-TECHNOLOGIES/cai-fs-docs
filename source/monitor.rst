**Monitor**
~~~~~~~~~~~

Monitoring is important because data pipelines usually run without
manual oversight. DSCW supports multiple logging mechanisms.

The logging feature is important for diagnosing potential problems when
running the data pipeline. In addition to the standard logging and
metrics capabilities, DSCW supports the ability to use DSCW health
checks to detect operational errors in the DSCW platform itself .

All logs related to Pipelines including the owner, event and more are
located in the **Audit Logs**.
