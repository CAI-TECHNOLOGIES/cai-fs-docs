**Distributed Trace** 
---------------------

We have built a distributed tracing tool meant to allow normal
users/developers to have a central overview of how user requests perform
across multiple services. This tool is a way to see and understand the
whole chain of events in a complex interaction between microservices.
Traces can be queried in **Monitor -> Distributed Trace.**

-  Enter your service name and optionally add an operation name.

-  Add appropriate values for tags and lookback period and hit search.
